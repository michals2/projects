# Code Test Instructions
## Overview
The purpose of this test is to get an idea of your abilities with html, css, and javascript responsive component.

## Rules
* It's very important to match the design. This component came out of a project and is indicative of the type of work you'll encounter.
* This must work on iOS 6+, Android 4+, IE11+, Edge 12+, Chrome 31+, Safari 6.1+, and Firefox 28+.
* If you choose to use some sort of CLI compilation, include a compiled folder so that the html file can be dragged directly into the browser.
* Upload a zip file to dropbox, google drive, or any other semi private storage service. Please do not post this on a public repository such as Github.
* Both the accordion and tab javascript must be hand coded. Please do not use any prebuilt plugins for these features.
* With the above rule in mind, you are welcome to use any other javascript framework you'd like such as jQuery.

## Bonus
* Write JavaScript in Vanilla ES5.
* Write JavaScript in ES6+ while ensuring it's usable in all of the required browsers.
* Write OOP JavaScript.
* Add CSS transitions to accordion and tab events.
* Create accordion + and - icons with pure css.
* Use SASS.
